# ðŸ«€ Interpretable Heart Disease Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using the Cleveland dataset. 

We focus on **model interpretability**, using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to understand how each feature impacts the modelâ€™s predictions.
